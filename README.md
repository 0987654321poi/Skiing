## Project Information
This is a simple project that I am working on over my break. It is a time waster game that is inspired
by slalom skiing. The idea of the game is to move the skier icon around the red and blue circles as they 
move up the screen, simulating the skier skiing down the hill and around the slalom gates. It is currently
a work in progress and needs some refactoring. By the end, I want to have the game fully functional
along with a home screen that has instruction.
